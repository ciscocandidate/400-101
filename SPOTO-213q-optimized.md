## Q6.

![exhibit](exhibits/q6.jpg)

Refer to the exhibit. R1 is unable to ping the device at 10.3.3.3. Which two options are possible reasons for the problem? (Choose two.)

A. The static route is configured as a host route.

B. The static route points to a broadcast interface without a n

C. IP CEF is disabled on the local router.

D. Proxy ARP is disabled on the next-hop router.

E. The dynamic routing protocol configuration is missing. 

F. IP CEF is disabled on the  remote router.

Answer: BD

Explanation: The problem with configuring a broadcast interface as next-hop is that in the absence of a next-hop address, the router will issue an ARP request for the destination IP 10.3.3.3 - you can see that being done in the ARP debug in the exhibit.  The only way that could work for a non-connected prefix is if an attached router with a known route to that subnet had proxy-ARP configured, in which case it would reply to the ARP request with its own information and forward the packet on.  I've seen this one in production.
